// pointers syntax: data_type *pointer_name;

//two different purposes in pointers. one is to declare apointer variable and other is in an operator to get the value stored at address stored in pointer.


//basic

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    //normal variable
    int var = 10;
    
    //pointer variable ptr that stores address of var 
    int *ptr = &var;
    
    //directly accessing ptr will give us an address
    printf("%d",ptr);
    
    return 0;
}
